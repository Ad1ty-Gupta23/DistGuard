# 🛡️ Decentralized Cybersecurity Framework  
_A Blockchain-Based Collaborative Defense System_

> **Secure Together. Defend Smarter. Stay Resilient.**

---

## 🌟 Vision  

Cyberattacks are projected to cost **$10.5T annually by 2025**, and centralized security systems are failing due to single points of failure.  

Our **Decentralized Cybersecurity Framework** uses **blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs, and confidential computing** to enable organizations to **collaboratively defend** against cyber threats — without exposing sensitive data.  

---

## ✅ Core Objectives  

- 🚫 **IP Blocklisting** – Decentralized threat intelligence sharing with consensus-driven enforcement  
- 🔥 **Dynamic API Firewalling** – Behavioral anomaly detection with ZK-proofs  
- 🔐 **Confidential Computing** – Secure enclaves (Intel SGX/AMD SEV) for sensitive API logic  
- 🎖️ **Incentivized Participation** – Token-based rewards for validated threat reports  
- 📜 **Immutable Compliance Logs** – Blockchain ensures GDPR/HIPAA-ready audit trails  

---

## 🧭 How It Works  

### 1. Node Registration  
- Servers register as blockchain nodes with cryptographic IDs.  
- Nodes commit to sharing **anonymized threat data**.  

### 2. IP Blocklisting  
- Nodes submit **hashed malicious IPs**.  
- >50% consensus updates firewall rules network-wide.  
- Privacy-first: only proofs & hashes are shared.  

### 3. Dynamic API Firewalling  
- Local ML models detect abnormal API traffic.  
- Nodes submit **ZK-proofs** of anomalies.  
- Smart contracts throttle/block suspicious endpoints.  

### 4. Confidential Computing  
- Critical API logic runs in **secure enclaves**.  
- Prevents insider threats & guarantees code integrity.  

### 5. Incentives & Reputation  
- Valid reports → **Token rewards + reputation boost**.  
- False reports → **Reputation penalties**.

## 🔄 Simplified Workflow  

1. **Threat Detected** → Node A detects brute-force from IP `X`  
2. **Consensus Validation** → Nodes B & C confirm anomaly via ZK proofs  
3. **Enforcement** → Smart contract updates firewalls across nodes  
4. **Reward Issued** → Node A gets tokens + rep boost
